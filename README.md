Higher Technician in Network Systems Administration (ASIR) specialized in DevOps and infrastructure automation.

With complete training in systems administration (2023-2025) and practical experience since 2022 at the UPV Testing Center. Passionate about automation, containers and cloud-native architectures. 
I've worked implementing LAMP Stack solutions, automating tasks with Bash and Python, and diving deep into DevOps tools.

My goal is to develop as a DevOps Engineer, creating scalable, secure and efficient systems that unite development and operations. Currently seeking new opportunities to apply and expand my knowledge.

My journey in the IT world began with a deep curiosity to understand how systems work. During my ASIR training, I discovered my true passion: automation and systems administration.

I specialized in container and orchestration technologies, starting with Docker and learning Kubernetes fundamentals. My goal has always been to eliminate repetitive tasks and create efficient systems.

Currently, my focus is on learning DevOps tools, implementing infrastructure best practices and improving my skills in automation and cloud technologies.
